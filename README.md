📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end analytical solution using the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into a scalable, high-performance Business Intelligence dashboard to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and seller performance.

🚀 Project Evolution (v2.0): Initially built using a flat, denormalized SQL view. I recently refactored the architecture into a proper Star Schema in Power BI, implementing a custom dynamic Date table and advanced DAX Time Intelligence measures, significantly improving model performance and analytical depth.

🏗️ Data Architecture & Workflow

1️⃣ Staging & Production Layer (PostgreSQL)

Raw Ingestion: CSV data loaded into a staging schema using TEXT data types to prevent truncation and allow flexible profiling.

Data Cleaning & Typing: Transformed raw data with strict data typing (NUMERIC, TIMESTAMP, INT), handled missing values, and applied business logic to preserve referential integrity.

Validation: Reconciled revenue between SQL tables and the BI Fact table to guarantee 100% accuracy. Accounted for a 775-order discrepancy caused by intentional INNER JOIN logic filtering out incomplete records.

2️⃣ Data Modeling (Power BI)

Designed a Star Schema with a central Fact_sales table and multiple dimensions (Dim_customers, Dim_products, Dim_sellers).

Continuous Date Table: Generated a dynamic, continuous Dim_date table using DAX to ensure seamless compatibility with Time Intelligence functions.

<br><br>


3️⃣ Advanced DAX & Business Metrics
Developed robust DAX measures to track critical business KPIs, enabling deep-dive analysis into period-over-period performance:

Time Intelligence: SalesYTD (Year-to-Date), SalesLY (Last Year), and YoY%_Sales_variance to track growth trends.

Financial Metrics: Total_Gross_Revenue, Net_sales, and Total_shipping_cost.

Behavioral Metrics: AvgTicket (Average Order Value), Total_orders, and Total_customers.

<br><br>

📈Category Performance: Health & Beauty is the leading category, contributing heavily to the total revenue.

📈Market Concentration: A significant portion of revenue is concentrated among top-tier sellers and specific geographic regions (e.g., SP state).
